# Linguistic_Mini_Project

Exploring Language with Python: A Mini Corpus Linguistics Project

This notebook was created for a fun, hands-on class where linguistics students learn how to see language data with Python!
We start with real survey responses, clean and tokenize them, and then explore:
	•	Which words and emojis do people use most
	•	What emotions appear (positive/negative)
	•	How often speakers say yo, nosotros, ellos
	•	How much English and Spanish mix in the same comment

By the end, students can visualize patterns, build their own small analyses, and understand how linguists and AI systems both begin — by breaking text into tokens and examining how they interact.

🛠 Tools: Python, pandas, regex, Counter, matplotlib
🎯 Goal: Show that programming and linguistics can work together to discover meaning in data.
